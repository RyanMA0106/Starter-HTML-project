<html>
<!--html encloses all of the website and allows 1 head and 1 body-->
<head>
	<!--head is the stuff you dont see ie. style sheets-->
	<title>First go at html</title>
	<!--title it important as it is name in tab on a browser and also the title for pages linking the site, also what is shown when searching the browser-->
</head>
<body>
	<!-- body is the stuff you do see, ie the meat of the website-->
	<h1>This would be most important heading</h1>
	<h2>Then it goes down in importance/size </h2>
	<h3>This is another heading of lesser importance</h3>
	<h4>Heading four</h4>
	<h5>Heading 5</h5>
	<h6>Heading 6 is the smallest you can go</h6>
	<!-- all headers are 'block level elements' meaning they get their own line on the page even if presented in html on the same line of code -->
	<p>this is some <strong>random</strong> text ect <em>ect</em> ect ect blah blah blah</p>  
	<!-- strong makes the text bold and is more meaning ful than the b tool as it says more about the text(looked at later in work) -->
    <!-- em is a function to make words italic this stands for emphasis and is better to use than '<i>' it seperates styling from structure as saying italic is a style function but saying it is emphasised is structure -->

	<!-- text isnt block level element it is instead a 'in line' element so it will all go on same line. to change this use the paragraph 
	function -->
